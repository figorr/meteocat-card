# üå§Ô∏è Meteocat Card

Custom Lovelace card for Home Assistant to display weather data from the [Meteocat integration](https://github.com/figorr/meteocat).  
Supports animated or static icons with day/night variants, and shows hourly and daily forecasts.

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)
1. Go to **HACS ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí Custom repositories**.
2. Add this repository: https://github.com/figorr/meteocat-card
3. Install **Meteocat Card** from HACS.

### Manual
1. Copy the compiled file `dist/meteocat-card.js` to your Home Assistant `www` folder, preferably in a subfolder for organization:
   
   ```text
   /config/www/meteocat-card/meteocat-card.js
   ```

2. Add the resource to your Lovelace configuration:

   ```yaml
   url: /local/meteocat-card/meteocat-card.js
   type: module
   ```

3. Place the icon SVGs that are located in /www/meteocat-card/icons into your Home Assistant setup at:

   ```text
   /config/www/meteocat-card/icons/
   ```

## Icon Setup

- a- prefix ‚Üí animated icons (e.g., a-clear-day.svg)
- s- prefix ‚Üí static icons (e.g., s-clear-day.svg)
- -day suffix ‚Üí daytime icon
- -night suffix ‚Üí nighttime icon
- clear-night ignores the day/night suffix

Example icons:
```css
a-clear-day.svg
a-clear-night.svg
s-rain-day.svg
s-rain-night.svg
```

## Usage

### Using a Meteocat Weather Entity (Recommended)

Use your Meteocat Weather entity to get full functionality including current conditions, hourly and daily forecasts:

   ```yaml
   type: custom:meteocat-card
   entity: weather.meteocat_station_id_weather_town_name
   option_static_icons: false  # set true for static icons
   icons: "/local/meteocat-card/icons/"
   ```

   - entity: Your Meteocat Weather entity (e.g., weather.meteocat_yourtown)
   - option_static_icons: true for static icons, false for animated icons
   - icons: Base path to your SVG icons

The card automatically selects the correct icon based on the current condition and time of day.

#### Example Lovelace Card

   ```yaml
   type: custom:meteocat-card
   entity: weather.meteocat_station_id_weather_town_name
   option_static_icons: false
   icons: "/local/meteocat-card/icons/"
   ```

   **The card shows:**

   - Current weather condition and icon
   - Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation
   - Hourly forecast with temperature and precipitation bars
   - Daily forecast with min/max temperatures and precipitation

### Using Individual Meteocat Sensors

You can also use individual sensors with the card, for example:

```yaml
type: custom:meteocat-card
entity: sensor.meteocat_station_id_town_name_temperatura
```

Replace sensor.meteocat_temperature with any other sensor from your Meteocat integration (humidity, wind speed, precipitation, UV index, etc.).

Note: Using the Weather entity is recommended to get the full forecast display.

## Configuration Options

| Option               | Type    | Default           | Description                                                   |
|----------------------|--------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `entity`             | string | ‚Äî               | **Required.** Your Meteocat weather entity or sensor.        |
| `option_static_icons`| boolean| `false`         | Use static icons (`true`) or animated icons (`false`).        |
| `icons`              | string | `/local/icons/` | Path to the folder containing the SVG icons.                 |

## Notes

- Make sure your Meteocat integration provides a Weather entity (not just individual sensors) to get full card functionality.
- The card dynamically determines day or night icons if the entity‚Äôs condition is not clear-night.
- For best results, keep your /config/www/meteocat-card/icons/ folder updated with the latest icons from the repo.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```yaml
type: custom:meteocat-card
entity: sensor.meteocat_station_id_town_name_temperatura
```

### Using Animated Icons

```yaml
type: custom:meteocat-card
entity: weather.meteocat_station_id_weather_town_name
option_static_icons: false
icons: "/local/meteocat-card/icons/"
```

### Using Static Icons

```yaml
type: custom:meteocat-card
entity: weather.meteocat_station_id_weather_town_name
option_static_icons: true
icons: "/local/meteocat-card/icons/"
```
